Updating Oxwall, Plugins & Themes
================================
Changes are the common thing in the world and except the same with Oxwall. To provide more features and fix bugs, new versions are released often. Updates are of no use, if you don't apply those updates to your website. Updates can be for the Oxwall Core, Plugins or for the Themes.
When you update the core, plugin or theme, the new version is available in your site.

Updating Oxwall Core
====================
The Oxwall core can be updated in 2 different ways. The easiest is the Auto-update option. Both the methods are explained below.
Auto-update
Auto-update is all about clicking a button in admin area and entering your FTP details. Currently as of Oxwall 1.5.3 , this feature does not run smooth on all possible server setups.Majority of users reported that the upddate via FTP does not work due to secured FTP (sFTP) related settings. You can still go manual update if you face issues with auto-update.

Manual update
============
The Oxwall core can be updated manually by following the below process.
1.	Download Oxwall Update Pack at Oxwall.org/download page. Please note that you should download the Update Pack and not the full download pack. 
2.	Unpack it to the root folder of your software install 
3.	Finalize update by calling yoursite.com/ow_updates where yousite.com is your actual Oxwall site 
Caution: Please ensure you have backup of your fie
Note: All custom code modifications made before the update will be lost. If, indeed, you have changed the code, copy all changes before the update and apply them again once the script is updated.
