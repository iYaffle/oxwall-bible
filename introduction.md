In early 2009 Oxwall began life as OpenWack, an open-source project started by software developer Skalfa eCommerce. 
It was mostly an empty framework at the time of introduction, and significant alpha and beta development followed. 
On July 24, 2010, the OpenWack team announced in unclear terms that a potential threat to the project came in the form of a name dispute, prompting the team to rename the project to "Oxwall". 
After more betas and release candidates, version 1.0 of Oxwall finally arrived on January 14, 2011. 
On April 6, the development team announced that with the release of version 1.1 of Oxwall, the project would be transferred from Skalfa to a new entity, the Oxwall Foundation, in effect granted intellectual rights and the Oxwall trademark in the process.

The Oxwall core is extensible by plugins. The strength of this platform is strongly based on plugins, which act as "complete units of functionality. 
The plugins are available at the Oxwall Store, and are provided both by native and third-party developers. 
Themes are used to change how the site looks. Oxwall comes with few default and free Themes. 
But there are lot more themes available from the store.
